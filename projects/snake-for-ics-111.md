For my final project in ICS 111, I was put in a group with two other people to create our own game. After much discussion, we decided to pay homage to an old retro game that not a lot of people talk about anymore. Snake's design dates back to 1976 in the same era as the arcade game, Blockade. There are now hundreds of different versions of the game all over the web.

You can watch a demonstration of our game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUIVwGbwxM&ab_channel=austinchong4).
