As an American Soldier, I am proud of the heritage that I am helping extend for our future generations to look towards. When I first enlisted into the Army Reserves, I thought of Mortuary Affairs Specialist as another job, not understanding the profession's more profound meaning. I did not understand why everyone in the military thought so highly of the people in this occupation due to my inexperience. After attending Advanced Individual Training in Fort Lee, VA, I knew more about the history behind Mortuary Affairs but felt that I had no connection to the heart of the MOS.

Then, I was deployed to Saudi Arabia with the rest of my company, who were stationed at other countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and many others. Mortuary Affairs Specialists work in small teams of 4-6 due to the low numbers across both Active Duty and the Reserves. When my company started processing fallen heroes, I finally figured out why this profession was unique. Not only do you have to be healthy physically, but you must detach all emotions once you enter your work area. Your only mission is to transport fallen heroes with the utmost dignity and respect back to their families in the continental U.S. I have never been more proud of anything than the military occupational specialty that I serve in.
