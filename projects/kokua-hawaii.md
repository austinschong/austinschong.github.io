For my final project in ICS 314, my professor, Dr. Johnson, put us into groups with specific project ideas to create web applications for. Our group was assigned Crowd-Sourced COVID Info, which gave us an idea to create a website with direct links, phone numbers, emails, and information for our users that have difficult finding specific resources.

You can access and click through the website [here](https://http://104.236.11.85/#/) and our GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/covid-kokua)!
