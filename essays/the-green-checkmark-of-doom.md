**What's the big deal about coding standards? Why is it so important?**Â You know, I asked myself that same question when I first started in my Computer Science. From my first semester of college until now, I can see the importance of coding standards and how that might help people indefinitely. While I was taking ICS 111, I read through code that was difficult to understand and see where the different scopes were. The code that I saw had lines indented all over the place, incorrect usage of commenting, and curly braces not aligned with their functions. Even for someone ultimately new about programming and Java, I had so many complaints about the disorganized code, and then I learned about checkstyle in ICS 211.

**Checkstyle changed my outlook on coding standards in the long run.** Indents and alignment of your lines of code make it so much easier to navigate and analyze what it is doing. You don't want to look at 30+ lines of code and wonder, "Wait, where was I again? I thought I was at line 24?". When I started Computer Science, I was taught the importance of attention to detail because the smallest mistake can make or break your program. Coding standards help emphasize that attention to detail and make it much easier to learn other programming languages.

**ESLint was another great tool that I have learned to appreciate in Computer Science.** Along with the little green checkmark in the top-right corner, it also helps you correct any formatting or syntax error you've made in your code. Just like in Eclipse, it will show you exactly where you made your mistake and the options you have to fix it. During the in-class WOD's, it is a bit stressful to fix the errors since you are on a tight time-constraint. However, ESLint is a great way to help synthesize excellent formatting and coding standards in any of your projects.
