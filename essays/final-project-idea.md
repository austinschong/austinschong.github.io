**Overview**<br />
One of the biggest problems I see in the nation is miscommunication and misdirection regarding state/federal funded programs. Many websites do not provide accurate resources to programs such as EBT, CARES Act Funding, Financial Aid, and many others. This is a sustainable resource due to the pandemic; life will not be the same after we get through COVID-19. 

Solutions:
- Create a web application with different tabs sorting COVID-19 relief into different categories
- Provide information such as hotlines, websites, and phone numbers for each organization
- If more assistance is required, create a help ticket system so we can answer questions directly

**Approach** <br />
This website will have to be updated with new, pertinent information weekly to keep up with all COVID-19 news. There will be tabs that sort different types of relief or resources relevant on a case by case basis. 

Mockup Page Ideas:
- The landing page will include a welcome message with information on how to navigate the website
- A page for COVID-19 State Guidelines if people need it as a reference
- A page where people can access financial relief programs and applications
- A page that provides links and phone numbers for programs that offer COVID-19 assistance
- There should also be a help ticket page where people can submit more specific questions they cannot find answers for


**Beyond the Basics** <br />
There are also some advanced features that I think could be implemented after the basic formatting of the pages:
- Having a self-input page where people could add COVID-19 information relevant to a specific category
- Creating an FAQ page that we can update when we do get questions from the help ticket page
- Setting up a page specifically for COVID news sorted in chronological order starting with the most recent news update
