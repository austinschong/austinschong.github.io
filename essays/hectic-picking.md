**When I first heard about Semantic UI, I was intrigued by the topic and thought I would have a great time! Oh boy, was I wrong.**Â I mean, it sounded super cool and had a nice ring to it whenever you said it, but it was a very difficult learning experience this time around. Semantic UI is very specific when it comes to formatting and could take hours for you to replicate a single webpage. Being that this was the first time I have ever encountered a UI framework, I had to be very patient with the elements and learn how to format my page to my liking.

**"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." - Thomas H. Palmer.** That pretty much covers my entire experience with this framework. I had to conjure up every bit of patience I could find and find my way through this past week. Formatting webpages can be a chore that takes hours upon hours of work and may not even turn out to your liking. However, it is a helpful framework that provides a nice introduction to the UI module without scaring you away from it forever. It was nice that I could refer to the Semantic UI Doc to find definitions and examples of each element and how to format each of them. It felt like I learned a whole new language this week and it may have been harder for me because I was so used to conventional programming and syntax.

**It was a rollercoaster of a ride, but it was all worth it in the end.** As a Computer Science major, we are expected to learn every single day and keep ourselves up to date with the latest programming languages, tech news, and others. This week was just another way for us to fulfill that expectation by diving into the world of UI Frameworks. Even though it was an up and down week for me, it was still a great learning experience and I do prefer having very beautiful designs on a webpage rather than just raw HTML/CSS. Without UI Frameworks, webpages would not be appealing and wouldn't attract that many visitors, so it does help a lot in that sense.
