For my final project in ICS 314, my professor, Dr. Johnson, put us into groups with specific project ideas to create web applications for. Our group was assigned Crowd-Sourced COVID Info, which gave us an idea to create a website with direct links, phone numbers, emails, and information for our users that have difficult finding specific resources.

My contribution in the project was mostly Front-End development while assisting in some Back-End Database work. I formatted the NavBar with access to different pages and made the Home and Social Services page. I also developed tests that checked to see if all pages of the website were displayed correctly and if the NavBar functioned properly to navigate to all the pages.

You can access and click through the website [here](http://104.236.11.85/#/) and our GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/covid-kokua)!
