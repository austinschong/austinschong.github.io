For my second project in ICS 111, I was given the assignment to create a Roomba program that travels in random distances and directions on the screen. Every time the Roomba would pick up dirt or an object, we would have to play a sound to show the two objects' collision. Once the Roomba had picked up all of the dirt, another sounds plays, and the program ends.

You can watch the demonstration of the program [here](https://youtu.be/SMOFSVkY4qE).
