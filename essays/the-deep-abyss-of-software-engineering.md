**What is there to know about Software?** I asked myself that question up until this semester when I started taking ICS 314. Software Engineering seemed like such a far stretch for me due to my lack of inexperience. Before college, I had no prior knowledge or experience with programming, including the major languages such as Java, C/C++, Python, and others.

**Once I dug through Google for some answers, I saw a lot of similar inquiries.** For one, you have to have a basic understanding of data structures and language syntax. Algorithms are also a fundamental part of coding because that's what makes or breaks your program. 

A big reason for taking this class is to broaden my knowledge of Computer Science by learning about more programming languages. As you know more languages, I feel that it'll be much easier to adapt to other aspects of Computer Science. The field is always expanding and evolving due to new technologies and research. You can never stop learning in this subject, so I love pursuing the knowledge every day.
